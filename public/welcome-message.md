## Major Chatty update! 

We've added support for image recognition! You can now add one or more images to your
chat by clicking on the camera symbol in the input box. This is supported for `gpt-4o`
conversations only. 

The image becomes part of your prompt and you ask Chatty anything about it. Like:
- "Translate text in the image into English"
- "Explain what this diagram means"
- "Create a table of the text this image"
- "What does the error in this screenshot mean?"
- ...and anything else you want to know about the picture.

Have fun!
